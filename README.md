### Objective
To analyse the earthquakes data of India and its neighbouring countries

### Tools Languages and Libraries Used

- VS code
- Tableau for dashboarding
- Python
- pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, regex, seaborn

### Insights

- The avg depth of earthquake is 26.669 which is greater than the 50th percentile ie 10. Since mean > median, the data for depth is right skewed.
- The avg magnitude of earthquake is 4.50 on the richter scale which is slightly greater than the 50th percentile of mag ie 4.40, for the magitude, the data distribution is very slight skewed to the right.
- Also on an average the earthquake fell on 30.5 kms depth above or below the mean depth
- Coming to magnitude, on an average it fell 0.39 above or below mean magnitude 4.5 on the richter scale for the entire 2020-2021
- The most common magnitude of earthquake in 2020-2021 period was of 4.3 in the richter scale. Out of the total earthquakes happened in India and around its neighbouring countries, 83 no of earthquakes , ie, almost 13.5% of the total earthquakes had this magnitude followed by 4.4 and 4.5 being the second common.
- Overall if I see, earthquakes mostly happened in between the range of 4.1 to 5.1 richter scale after which from 5.2 onwards, the no of earthquakes which happened is less in comparision
- The highest magnitude was 6.3 which was hit in western xizang (tibet) and in Hotan (China). The depth of both the earthquakes were similar of about 10kmts. The places are not very far away from each other as it is inevitable from the lat and long. Moreover they were hit at a gap of one month from each other
- India recorded above 25 no of earthquakes and hence tops the list being the highest country having larger no of above 5 richter scale earthquake in this period.
- The least being Bhutan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Indonesia where such no is only 1
- India tops having most no of earthquakes with almost 300 out of 614 ie, 49% of the earthquakes happened are from this region
- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Srilanka has the least
